<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Adam Corey Rowell. I'm currently based in Durham, NC. I previously worked as a 6th grade teacher who 
  taught computer science. The curriculum covered basic HTML, CSS, and block based Javascript, and that's where I 
  first discovered how much I enjoyed coding.</p>

<p>Professionally, I currently work as a broker-dealer agent for an investment firm. I hold several financial licenses:
  the SIE, the Series 7, and the Series 63. The majority of my work history has been in client facing roles.
</p>

<p>Outside of work, my life involves video games, baking for fun, and my dog Sansa and cat Arya.</p>
