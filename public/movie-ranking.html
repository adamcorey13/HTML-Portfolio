 <h3>Love Actually</h3>

 <p>It's a silly little romcom set at Christmas. British humor and actors. What else needs to be said?</p>

 <h3>The Devil Wears Prada</h3>

 <p>Anne Hathaway. Meryl Streep. Emily Blunt. Fabulous clothes.</p>

 <h3>Mean Girls</h3>

 <p>Stop trying to make fetch happen. It's not going to happen.</p>
